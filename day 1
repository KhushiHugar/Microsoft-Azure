Here's a simplified version of what i have
learned today:

Search for virtual machines.
Create a new virtual machine.
In Subscription -> Resource group, name it (e.g., "vm_43").
In Instance details, choose the region (e.g., "West US 3").
In Administrator account, set username and password (e.g., "Password@123").
In Image, select "Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition Hotpatch - x64 Gen2."
Under Select inbound ports, pick HTTP (80) and RDP (3389).
In Networking -> Virtual network, give any name.
Review and create, then click Create.
Go to resource after creation.
Connect and download the RDP file.
Run the RDP, then click Connect, Next, and Yes.
Your VM is ready to open.
In the VM, go to Server roles, select Web Server (IIS), and click Install.
For starting or stopping services:

Go to Server Manager -> Dashboard -> IIS, and you can manage your VM's services from there.
